## Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning
### Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on breast cancer classification. 
Our goal is to leverage state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
## Features
- **Model Development**: We have developed a machine learning model using Logistic Regression, a widely used classification algorithm, to predict breast cancer.

- **Model Evaluation**: We assess our model's performance using the **Accuracy Score**, a common metric for classification tasks. We strive for high accuracy to ensure reliable breast cancer classification.

- **Data Preprocessing**: Our data preprocessing pipeline includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization to ensure high-quality input data for our model.

- **Interpretability**: We provide explanatory analysis and visualization tools to understand model predictions and identify critical features contributing to classification results.

- **Deployment (Future)**: We are actively working on deploying the trained model as a web application or API for real-world usage.
## Data
his repository uses the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn, a built-in dataset for breast cancer classification.
- **Source**: [scikit-learn's built-in dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- **Description**: The Breast Cancer dataset contains diagnostic features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass. The goal is to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- **Dataset Characteristics**: 569 instances, 30 features (numerical), no missing values.
- **Usage Instructions**: You can load the dataset using the following code snippet in Python:
